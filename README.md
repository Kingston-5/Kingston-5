**`Jack Of all Software Traits (Founder @kingstonenterprises/Developer/Digital Craftsman)`**

I`m the very definition of a software enthusiast; despite working in web development and data science professionally, I always take the time to dabble in anything and everything code related that I can find. i like working on projects in a variety of programming languages and i plan to work with them all.

I'm also the founder of Kingston Enterprises, a small general software development company that aims to use its technical knowledge and expertise to develop innovative solutions to solve real-world problems by helping companies create new applications, products, and services that reduce the cost of existing products and services while increasing their reliability, safety, efficiency, and value.
